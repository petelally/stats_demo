# Power calculations

Here is a short, interactive Jupyter notebook which takes you through power calculations for a comparison of the means of 2 independent groups. It also validates these calculations against a Monte Carlo simulation.

You have a few options:
- You can download this yourself and run interactively on your device (see environment.yml for specific library dependencies)
- You can run this online interactively at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/petelally/stats_demo/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Ftrials_powercalc_sim.ipynb (or click this button:

- You can visualise this online without direct interaction at: https://nbviewer.org/github/petelally/stats_demo/blob/main/trials_powercalc_sim.ipynb
